## Assignment
At an all-round skating championship the following distances are skated in
succession: 500 metres, 5000 metres, 1500 metres and 10000 metres. Each time is
accurately registered in hundredths of seconds. The times achieved on the
various distances are converted to points by converting each time to a 500
metres time. The skater with the lowest total number of points may call himself champion.

An Applet or GUI must be developed for which the following information can be
entered for an unknown number of participants (max. 24):

- Name
- Time 500 metres
- Time 5000 metres
- Time 1500 metres
- Time 10000 metres

(all times as one number in the format: `mmsshh` a time of 1 min 55.48 seconds
is entered as 15548)

- After the data of a participant has been entered the total number of points
for that participant must be calculated.

- After all participants are entered the winners of the various distances (name
and time) and the winner of the total ranking (lowest total number of points)
must be displayed.
