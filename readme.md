## Module Java1
This module is given at Stenden University of applied science in the third block of the first year. This module
is an introduction into object oriented programming in the Java language. The goal of this module is to get an general
idea about object oriented design like using inheritance, encapsulation and The single responsibility principle.<br>

## Module Java2
This module is given at Stenden University of applied science in the first block of the second year. This module
is an extension of Java1 and expands on more advanced object oriented concepts in the Java language. The goal of 
this module is to dive deeper in object oriented design patterns and the Java language like access modifiers, constants,
using and writing documentation, lose coupling, responsibility driven design, Unit testing, debugging, autoboxing and
polymorphism.<br>

## Module Java3
This module is given at Stenden University of applied science in the second block of the second year. This is the last 
Java module of the study. The goal of this module is to learn more object oriented design patterns and the Java language
like polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces, graphical user interfaces, event handling, file processing, overriding,
static and dynamic types, drawing UML diagrams and the implementation of diagrams in java code.<br>
